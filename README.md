JS and CSS Clock

Lesson 2 of JavaScript30 was to make a realtime clock with second, minute, and hour hands. 
This lesson focused on both CSS and JavaScript. With CSS, styles were applied to adjust the start position of the hands,
make them look like a real clock where they overshoot slightly before bouncing back into place,
and ensuring a smooth transition between positions. 
JavaScript was used to adjust the rotation of the hands in accordance with the current time.

Final Thoughts

This lesson really helped me to better understand CSS transitions and transforms. 
This is something I would like to use more going forward to add that oh so sweet eye candy to my projects.
This lesson was pretty fun although I don’t I’ll be replacing my system clock with this anytime soon.
